updated 4/26/2022

This branch is used for active development. The code contained in this branch may or may not work. Use at your own risk.

Initial push (4/26/2022):
-rewrote plugin code so it is now an executable
-the revised plugin can be launched from within Eclipse (runs on citrix servers). Simply open the structure set and launch the executable (launchVMATTBIAutoPlan.esapi.dll)
-the revised plugin can also be directly launched, although the user will have to manually enter the MRN and select the appropriate structure set
-code based on beta branch v04/11/2022


My current clinic has v16.1 of Eclipse whereas the scripts were built in v15.6 (during my residency). This may cause a bit of a mismatch between the code and what Eclipse requires. Both scripts will run in v16.1
as they were recompiled with the necessary libraries to run in v16.1. The VMS.TPS libraries have been updated to v16.1. Minimal changes were required for the plug-in script.
However, the executable binary is now compiled and placed in /ESAPI_MT/VMATTBI_optLoopMT/VMATTBI_optLoopMT/bin/x64/debug instead of /ESAPI_MT/VMATTBI_optLoopMT/VMATTBI_optLoopMT/bin/debug
You need to modify the .ini configuration file inside the /bin/x64/debug directory for any changes to take effect if your clinic is using v16. 


If you have questions, leave a comment and i'll try and respond as quickly as I can.
